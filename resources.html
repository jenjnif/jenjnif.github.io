        <p class="course-summary">In 2017, whilst volunteering as a molecular biologist and working for a specialist Global Health web development company, I started to teach myself various aspects of software development. I enjoyed it so much that I left my job to pursue it as a career. Below are some of the books, websites, courses (mainly free/cheap) and tech events that I have come across along the way.</p>
