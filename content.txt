Jen Jones


I am a junior developer digging into new skills and learning each day. I am currently developing my python skills and making websites using JavaScript and html/css and playing with my new toy - a Raspberry Pi. Why I am not on my computer I love to spending time in the outdoors climbing, surrounded by mountains and wildlife.
