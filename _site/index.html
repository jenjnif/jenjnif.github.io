			      	<article><p><strong>In part 1 of ‘Creating a website contact page’ I discovered that I needed to use HTTP requests to submit the information entered in the contact form and sent it to me in the form of an email</strong></p>

<p>The second in my series of HTTP request articles walks through how to build a very simple HTTP request example to get a better understanding of how they work.</p>

			      	<article><p><strong>Recently, I built a contact form for a website using HTML and CSS. However, when the form was filled in and the submit button pressed, the information entered stayed put and an error message appeared. So… how do I fix this?</strong></p>

<p>The answer to this problem lies in HTTP requests.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/images/4-http/contactpage-and-error.png" alt="content form screenshot" width="90%" /></p>

<p>The next four posts will explore how to use HTTP requests to submit information entered in contact forms and then sent it in an email to a chosen recipient.</p>

			      	<article><p><strong>Last week I got a gift in the post. I love getting post, regardless of how underwhelming the content but this was extremely exciting - I opened this jiffy to find a Raspberry Pi Zero!</strong></p>

<p>In part 2 I describe how I used Jekyll to produce HTML and CSS files from my GitHub Pages markdown files and then transferred the files onto the Raspberry Pi to view my website.</p>
