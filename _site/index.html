                    <article><p><strong>As part of my job I implement features and fix bugs for a web application involving a session booking system (that I find very confusing!) with various login access levels and specifications.</strong></p>

<p>As many programmers will have found before me, projects quickly become warrens. Fixing one thing illuminates further issues and breaks other parts of the code. Before you know it you are in a complicated web of despair. It quickly became clear how important test driven development (TDD) is, especially as projects grow and become more complex as my one has.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/images/AlpineIntroMeet/EagleCrag.JPG" alt="Sunday visit to Eagle Crag" width="90%" /></p>

<p>The only real commitment I had on the trip was the Alpine Club UK Introductory meet in the Lake District the first weekend we were away. On the Friday of the meet we drove up from the Peak District where we had been climbing and headed towards the George Starkey hut in Patterdale.</p>

                  <article><p><strong>As someone who is self teaching themselves to programme, I try to go to as many tech meetups as possible.</strong></p>

<p>Some events are tech talks, some are workshops learning with mentors and others are more networking or promotional but I always come away from each one having learned or gained something new. A particularly good example, was meeting a new friend at s Codebar event who told me about Le Wagon’s free workshop series.</p>
