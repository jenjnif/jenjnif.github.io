I wanted to create a website for myself to document my progress learning to programme and an up to date log of where I am at.

I started to learn to programme in ernst in the summer of 2017 and so have missed a few of the early projects but I will 
attempt go backwards in time to document some of the more interesting ones that I learnt the most from.
