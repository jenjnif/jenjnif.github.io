Historically, I have not played much with computers, electronics or soldering irons but in recent years I've become more and more drawn to programming and last year I decided to finally act on my desire to learn to be a developer. This led me down a path along which, amongst huge amounts of excitement last May, I discovered Raspberry Pi. Then, about a month ago, a Raspberry Pi surprise gift package turned up in the post. Although my first foray did not go as exactly as expected - I did not solder the header onto my Raspberry Pi and create a robot worthy of fame and fortune on YouTube or even write a python program - I did manage to transform it into a server, use Jekyll to convert <a href="jenjnif.github.io">my GitHub Pages website</a> files into HTML and CSS and transfer them onto the Raspberry Pi and then view the site over the RP's network.

**You need to plug it in**

So, first things first, I needed to figure out how to set it up - we don't all know that  Raspberry Pi's need to be plugged in. I took all the parts, laid them out and figured out what they were.
