            <p class="cv-section-summary">My desire to be a programmer developed whilst volunteering as a molecular biologist and working for a specialist Global Health web development company based in London. I started self-teaching myself various aspects of programming and enjoyed it so much that in June 2017 I left my job to seriously pursue this path.</p>
            <p>In addition to working for DnA, I am currently building a website for a filmmaker using HTML/CSS and AWS, completing online courses, working on my own website/tech blog and adding to my GitHub repository. I am also currently working on my Python skills and discovering Raspberry Pi. I would love the opportunity to use and build on this knowledge in a professional setting, to create something and be proud of it.</p>

My role at DnA involves fixing bugs and adding features to their web application. Working with the small tech team at DnA has given me the opportunity to put all I have learnt in theory into practice with real Python code and data. This role has given me the opportunity to learn SQL, Postgres, SQLAlchemy and link this new knowledge with the front-end environment.</p>

            At Loud Cloud I gradually grew my skill base: building websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, delving into Amazon Web Services, learning Python and so on, and I have really enjoyed the work.
