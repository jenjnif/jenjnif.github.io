			<h3><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/flying-through-python">Flying Through Python</a>, Python, Codeschool (online), completed 3 April 2018</h3>
			<p class="course-summary">One of the things I find really useful about Codeschool is the screencasts that you can follow and work through once you have completed the courses. Each one is roughly an hour long and works through a project so you can consolidate all the knowledge that you just learnt in a useful way. The Python one was no exception and within a couple of hours I had built a <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-a-python-weather-forecast-mailer"> Weather Forecast Mailer</a>, which can be viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/jenjnif">GitHub account</a>.</p>
