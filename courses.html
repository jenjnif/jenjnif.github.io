        <p class="course-summary">In 2017, whilst volunteering as a molecular biologist and working for a specialist Global Health web development company, I started to teach myself various aspects of software development. I enjoyed it so much that I left my job to pursue it as a career. Below are some of the books, websites, courses (mainly free/cheap) and tech events that I have come across along the way.</p>

                <p class="course-summary">This is a good site to work on your programming skills and to practice the kind of tests you might get from a potential employer. I will be completing more challenges in the near future and perhaps my first contest. Watch this blog space!</p>

                <p class="course-summary">One of the things I find really useful about Codeschool is the screencasts that you can follow and work through once you have completed the courses. Each one is roughly an hour long and works through a project so you can consolidate all the knowledge that you just learnt in a useful way. The Python one was no exception and within a couple of hours I had built a <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-a-python-weather-forecast-mailer" target=”_blank”> Weather Forecast Mailer</a>, which can be viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/jenjnif" target=”_blank”>GitHub account</a>.</p>

                <p class="course-summary">This course was a great introduction to python with the view to working with data. It was based on the book "Python for Everybody" by Charles Severance, which I am reading to continue my learning. Afterwards I intend to read the book on which it is based, "Think Python" by Allen Downey.</p>
