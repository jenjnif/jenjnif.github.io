            <p class="course-summary">My desire to become a programmer developed whilst volunteering as a molecular biologist and working for a specialist Global Health web development company based in London. I started self-teaching myself various aspects of programming and enjoyed it so much that in June 2017 I left my job to seriously pursue this path.</p>
            <p>I have been working as a Python programmer since April 2018 alongside which I immersed myself in many books, tech meetups and (mainly free) courses. For those interested, below is a list of the main courses and resources I have used.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/jenjnif?h_r=internal-search&hr_r=1" target=”_blank”>HackerRank</a>, a great site to test your skills</h3>
                <p class="course-summary">I heard of HackerRank through a friend and am really enjoying working through the challenges. This is a good site to work on your programming skills and to practice the kind of tests you might get from a potential employer. I will be completing more challenges in the near future and perhaps my first contest. Watch this blog space!</p>

            <p class="course-summary">One of the things I find really useful about Codeschool is the screencasts that you can follow and work through once you have completed the courses. Each one is roughly an hour long and works through a project so you can consolidate all the knowledge that you just learnt in a useful way. The Python one was no exception and within a couple of hours I had built a <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-a-python-weather-forecast-mailer" target=”_blank”> Weather Forecast Mailer</a>, which can be viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/jenjnif" target=”_blank”>GitHub account</a>.</p>

            <p class="course-summary">This course was a great introduction to python with the view to working with data. It was based on the book "Python for Everybody" by Charles Severance, which I am reading to continue my learning. Afterwards I intend to read the book on which it is based, "Think Python" by Allen Downey.</p>
